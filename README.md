## Every Engine
This is just my own game engine I have been working on. Theres not much too it at the moment overall and just the start of a framework.

Its all written in C++ and OpenGL

Compiling is a bit unique due to the fact that I built my own build system in Python than using something like Make. Although I did base my ideas around it simlar to a MakeFile

As for compiling just run AutoCompile.py with Python3  and hopefully it should all work.  I should mention that I have not tried anything on Windows or MacOS and there are probably Linux specific things in the AutoCompiler script and C++ code.

### Dependancies
- SDL2
- GLEW
- g++ (For compiling)

### Compiling
`$ python3 AutoCompiler.py`
